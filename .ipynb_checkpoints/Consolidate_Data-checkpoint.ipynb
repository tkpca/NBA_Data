    "## Three pointers made\n",
    "- Three-pointers are a bit tricker. We know there are 613 games where no team attempted at least one three-point shot but didn't hit any after 1985-86.\n",
    "- We also know that the rise in three-point shots is a more recent phenomenon. \n",
    "- We also know that give or take teams have historically hit ~35% of their three point shots, https://www.besttickets.com/blog/nba-shooting/.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can do some things in Python for a sanity check.\n",
    " 1. We assume three pointers made are independent events.\n",
    " 2. On average slightly more than 1/3 of three-point shots are successful. Before we use that to see if totals look reasonable lets see if we can reduce the timeframe for analysis even--we know that teams have become a lot better at shooting three pointers over the years so it would be better to use a more precise calculation since we are only looking at 617 games.\n",
    " 3. See over a 39431 games (games after 1985) what the odds are that given x number of shots none are made.\n",
    "\n",
    "Setting this threshold to 15 drops the number to 5 games, which we can manually look up. (I confirmed games 0020300138, 0029100999, 0029100715, 0029100004, and 0029000408 all had 15 3PA with no makes.)"
